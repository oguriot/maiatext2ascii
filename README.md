Text Converter for Embedded Developers

Description

This application is designed to assist embedded developers by converting text input into binary, hexadecimal, and ASCII representations in real-time as you type. It provides a convenient tool during development and documentation phases, allowing quick conversion and reference of text into various formats commonly used in embedded systems programming.
Features

    Real-Time Conversion: Converts text instantly into binary, hexadecimal, and ASCII formats.
    Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface with text input and dynamic output displays.
    Developer Tool: Designed to support embedded developers in both coding and documentation tasks.
    Educational Utility: Helps in understanding and visualizing data representation in different formats.

Technologies Used

    C++: Core programming language for efficient text processing and user interface.
    Qt5: Framework for developing cross-platform graphical user interfaces.
    Text Encoding: Handles text conversion algorithms for binary, hexadecimal, and ASCII outputs.
    Embedded Development: Tailored to support developers working on microcontroller-based systems.
